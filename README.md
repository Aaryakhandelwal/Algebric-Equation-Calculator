# Equation-Calculator
The Advanced Equation Calculator is a versatile mathematical tool designed to assist users in solving equations of any degree. This Python-based calculator employs fundamental linear algebra concepts such as matrix multiplication, LU decomposition, and Gaussian elimination methods to provide accurate solutions.


With built-in error handling, the calculator can determine whether a system of equations is consistent or inconsistent, enhancing its utility and reliability.


Inorder to use the calculator clone the repository from github, and write the system of equations in the format:


Row 

Col

... ...

... ...


(Write the coefficients of the equations in matrix-format)

The output and the errors are shown on the terminal.
